    "title": "Our Story",
    "paragraph1": "Founded in 2023, WanderWise.ai emerged from a simple observation: while travel planning tools were abundant, none truly understood the individual needs and aspirations of adventure seekers.",
    "paragraph2": "Our founder, Alexandra Chen, experienced this firsthand during her years of solo travel. Despite extensive research, she often found herself on trails that didn't match her skill level or preferences.",
    "paragraph3": "Combining her expertise in AI with her passion for outdoor adventures, she assembled a team of technology experts and seasoned travelers to create WanderWise.ai - a platform that understands not just where you want to go, but why you want to go there. We are currently focused on research and development to ensure our platform meets the needs of adventure seekers.",
